## About Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about over 500,000 sample homes for sale in the United States. The data includes various fields such as property details, location, pricing, property type, and more. Each home has associated latitude and longitude information, making it suitable for geospatial analysis. Some properties in the dataset are owned by Zillow, indicated by the "is_owned_by_zillow" field with a value of 1.

This dataset is provided for learning and educational purposes and can be used for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) as well as predictive modeling tasks.

The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polartech/500000-us-homes-data-for-sale-properties)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory and predictive analysis on the US Real Estate dataset mentioned above. The dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of homes for sale in the US and offers an opportunity to understand the factors influencing home sale prices and their geographical distribution.

We will use the Streamlit framework to create a web application that will allow users to interact with the data and visualize the findings. Streamlit is an excellent choice for this project as it provides an easy-to-use interface for data exploration and allows us to create interactive data applications quickly.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the features of homes available for sale in the US.
2. Visualize the geographical distribution of homes using interactive maps.
3. Analyze the factors that influence home sale prices using data visualization techniques.
4. Build predictive models to estimate home sale prices based on relevant features.
5. Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to showcase the analysis and prediction results.
